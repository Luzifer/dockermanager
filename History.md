- Clustering through serf is no longer supported which means the corresponding CLI flags are removed in this version. The `hosts` list is still supported and can be used to start different container constellations on different hosts from one configuration file.
- Native support for dockerproxy has been removed as dockerproxy is no longer supported and end-of-life. As an alternative plese take a look at [nginx-letsencrypt](https://github.com/Luzifer/nginx-letsencrypt) which is more flexible and supports for example web-sockets which is not possible in dockerproxy.
